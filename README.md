This project is a personal portfolio website designed to be clean, scalable, and easy to maintain. It leverages the power of the Jaspr framework for building static sites with Dart and is organized as a monorepo using Melos.

## ✨ Features

- **Monorepo Architecture**: The project is organized as a monorepo using [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/), which simplifies dependency management and script execution across multiple packages.
- **Content-Driven**: Portfolio content such as projects, careers, and skills are managed through simple Markdown and YAML files, allowing for easy updates without touching the Dart source code.
- **PDF Resume Generation**: Includes a feature to dynamically generate a downloadable PDF version of the resume from the same content source.
- **Reusable UI Components**: A dedicated `ui` package provides a library of reusable components, ensuring a consistent design system across the application.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows a clean architecture with a clear separation of concerns between data models (`core`), features (`features/*`), UI components (`ui`), and the main application (`apps/portfolio`).

## 📂 Project Structure
